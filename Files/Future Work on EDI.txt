We have downloaded the small model (Qwen 2.5: 1.5B)



Future Work on EDI

Phase-2.1

1. SWE Benchmark Questions (100 questions around) (coding related only)

2. Percentage of Easy, medium and hard questions should be almost similar

3. Run all the questions at the same time with max_iter = 1

Phase-2.2: 
1. Muliple iterations

2. Archieve the iteration

3. Reinforcement Learning (Checking the code with the SWE bench answer and check accuracy (Time and Space Complexity)

4. Update the source code in file
